Preparing Your Hard Drive
Additional Help

-------------------------------------------------

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

	Windows ® 95 / 98 / 2000 compatible computer system with 16Mb of RAM (32Mb recommended)

	Direct X (TM) 7 (Drivers supplied on this CD)

	Pentium 266MHz Processor (300MHz recommended)

	Quad speed CD-ROM drive (8x recommended)

	Supports most major 3D acceleration graphics cards, compatible Soundcards and
	Joysticks through Direct X (TM) 7

NOTE: It may be necessary for you to update your hardware drivers to run this
game.

Tomb Raider Chronicles will not run on Windows NT 4.0, and was not designed to run on
Laptops.

-------------------------------------------------

DirectX 6.1:
In order for you to play the game, you must have DX7-compliant drivers for your video
card and sound card.  Please note that although DirectX 7 is installed with the game,
your video and sound card drivers will not be upgraded to DirectX 7 drivers.  You will
need to obtain the latest DX7 drivers from your card manufacturer.  If the game
does not run properly on your video card, and there are no DX7 drivers available for
your video card, you will have to run the game in software mode, by going into Options
and checking the 'Hardware Emulation' option.

-------------------------------------------------

Preparing Your Hard Drive:
To ensure that your installation is trouble free, you should check to see that your
hard drive and file system are both tuned for optimum performance. Windows 95/98
comes with two utility programs that find and fix any errors and optimize your
hard drive's performance. The first of these programs is called ScanDisk. ScanDisk
will check your hard drive for problems and can fix any that it finds. You can run
scandisk by clicking on the START button from the Windows 95/98 Taskbar, followed
by Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, and finally ScanDisk.

Once ScanDisk has finished running, you should next optimize your hard drive's
performance by running a program called Disk Defragmenter. You can run Disk
Defragmenter by clicking on the START button from the Windows 95/98 desktop,
followed by Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, and finally Disk
Defragmenter.

TROUBLESHOOTING
=================
Tomb Raider Chronicles uses Microsoft Compressed Audio for sound and music.
If you do not hear sound/music in the game you'll need to check your PC and make sure
the correct Windows components are activated.  To do this:

1. Exit the game and go to the Control Panel.  
2. Select the Add/Remove Programs Aplet.
3. Click on the Windows Setup Tab
4. You should see a selection icon called MULTIMEDIA which will have a check
in the box or no check at all.
5. Check this box (so a black check mark appears).  Click 'ok' and you'll be
prompted for your WINDOWS '95 CD in order
to install the correct Multimedia components to your hard drive.

There is also a driver issue with some sound cards and Microsoft's Compressed
Audio Format. If you experience any 'skipping or stuttering audio' please try
the following to clear up the problem:

1. Exit out of the game and run the TOMB4 Setup Option from the Start Bar.
2. Look at the Sound Adapter Check Box.  
3. Switch from Primary Sound Driver to the other available device (most
likely Yamaha).
4. Click OK 

SCREENGRABBER
===============
Tomb Raider Chronicles has a built in screen grabber for your viewing
pleasure. Hitting the  "   key during gameplay will snap a screenshot called
TOMB0000.TGA and place it on your hard drive in the C:\Program Files\Core
Design\Tomb Raider Chronicles (or wherever you installed the game).
The files will be numbered incremently as you snap them.  Please do not try and
map this key to one of Lara's in-game controls.


Installation

To install the game to your hard drive:
1. Place the game CD in your CD-ROM drive. 
2. After a few seconds, the Autorun Menu will come on screen.  Select the
Install option.  If this menu does not appear, click the Start button, select
Run and type D:\autorun (where D is the letter of your CD-ROM drive), then
click OK.
3. The program will detect whether you have certified DirectX 7 drivers which
allow the game to run properly under all configurations.  Your current
drivers may be updated as necessary.  
4. The installation routine will then install the game files to your hard drive.
At the end of the installation, you may be prompted to Restart your computer.
5. Upon completion of installation, run Setup to make sure your graphics card
is configured properly.
6. Click the Play button on the Autorun Menu or select Play in the
Core Design folder on the Start Menu to begin the game.

3D Graphic Cards

Tomb Raider Chronicles supports all 100% Direct3D compliant graphic cards.
This means that the game will run on every 3D accelerator card, providing
that you have installed DirectX7, and you have installed drivers for your
3D card which support all of the features of DirectX7 required by Tomb
Raider Chronicles

Graphics card manufacturers constantly update their drivers.  If you are
running the game on a 3D accelerator card, make sure you have the latest
drivers available for your card.  See the Tomb Raider Related Web Sites
section for a list of web sites where you will be able to obtain the very
latest drivers for your graphics card.


Technical Help

There are many 3D accelerator cards available on the market, and they all
will perform differently under the same conditions, depending on the chipset,
amount of video memory, and drivers installed.  The key to getting the best
performance out of your graphics card is to set the card to a higher
resolution, while maintaining a good frame rate with no texture loss.  Many
accelerator cards will run the game very efficiently at 640x480 High
Color.

If you notice texture drop out - white blank spots on menu text, objects,
terrain and characters including Lara, you will need to lower the graphics
resolution.  The card has run out of texture memory.  The graphics resolution
can be changed in the setup window.

If you are experiencing very low frame rates, you may want to lower the
screen resolution.  You can also reduce the screen size, which will leave a
border around the viewable area. The "-" key on the keypad will reduce the
screen size (while in-game), and the "+"  key on the keypad will increase the
screen size (while in-game). Reducing the resolution and screen size will
help the game run faster.

On some 3D cards, seaming may occur, drawing borders around polygons.  This
is most apparent when looking at the sky, which will have a tiled look to it.
 Turning off bi-linear filtering may help to fix this problem.

If you are getting any errors when running the game, such as runtime C++
error, or cannot find dinput.dll, reinstall DirectX7.  DirectX7 can be
installed directly from the game CD by running the dxsetup.exe
program from the directx directory.

If you continue to have problems, please contact your hardware manufacturer.


Setup

There are a large number of options available in the Setup window, which
allow you to configure the graphics, sound and controls within the game.  You
may need to change some of the graphics settings to achieve the best possible
performance (frame rate and detail level) on your particular graphics card.
Please refer to the Technical Help section for more details on graphics
configuration.

The Setup window is accessed by clicking the Setup button on the Autorun
Menu, or by selecting Setup from the Start menu. 


Joysticks & Gamepads

Tomb Raider Chronicles supports a wide variety of Windows 95
compatible game controllers, including USB controllers.

Software rendering mode

If you are running the game in 'software rendering' mode, to achieve
optimum performance you should choose a low screen
